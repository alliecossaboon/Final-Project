            <h1> Why the Avi Sustain Index Exists </h1>
            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p> Commerical aviation contributes significantly to carbon emmissions, with carbom emissions data often being inaccessible.
                Without this data, passengers are not able to make more envirnmentally friendly flight choices, and     
                airlines do not facr clear pressure to be envirnmentally responsible.  </p>
            <br>
            <h2> Our Solution </h2>
            <p> Our system, the Avi-Sustain Index, solves this problem by acting as a transparent intermediary. It
                ingests raw, technical flight data and transforms it into a simple metric, a carbon per passenger
                score. This simply takes complex aviation data and turns it into a powerful tool for the public and
                businesses to make better decisions.  Our solution’s success relies on a clearly defined architecture that manages data flow from the
                external API to user interface, incorporating a database for storing valuable historical data. </p>
            <br>
            <h2> Expectations </h2>
            <p> Our hope is that the Avi-Sustain Index will help individuals better understand the impact that commerical 
                aviation has on the environment. This site will help users make greener choices la la la la   </p>
