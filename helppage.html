                <p> Sample text: In a quiet village tucked between two blue 
                    mountains lived an old clockmaker named Aldren. His workshop 
                    was small but warm, always smelling faintly of cedar and engine oil. 
                    People said Aldren could fix anything that ticked, chimed, or spun, but 
                    hat they loved most wasn’t his skill — it was the tiny lantern he kept 
                    on his workbench.The lantern glowed even when it wasn’t lit. </p>
